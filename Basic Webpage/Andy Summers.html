		<p>The Police were a new kind of power trio, and Andy Summers was the main reason.
		Quickly moving away from punk, he recast jazz chords and reggae rhythms as headlong rock & roll.
		Summers played as sparely as possible, constructing clipped twitches or dubby washes of sound – leaving ample room for Sting and Stewart Copeland. "His tone and style were just absolutely perfect – he left space around everything," Rush's Alex Lifeson said. "And he can handle anything from beautiful acoustic playing to jazz to hybrid kinds of stuff."</p>
