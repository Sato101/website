		<p>By the turn of the century, new-metal grinders and post-grunge plodders had given loud guitars a bad reputation.
		Then Jack White hit the reset button. With each savage riff, he reconnected hard rock and roots music and showed that a blues-based band could escape what he calls "note-pushing Stratocaster white-blues bullshit."
		And he didn't let his analog leanings prevent him from ingenious use of a DigiTech Whammy pedal â€“ the secret behind the faux-bass thunder of "Seven Nation Army" and the screaming leads of songs like "Ball and Biscuit."</p>
